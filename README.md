### Configure authorization

**SOOS SCA Plugin** needs environment variables called **system properties (system.)** in teamcity which are passed as parameters. These system properties have to be declared as Parameters inside the project or the build settings, and they are required for the plugin to operate.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| system.SOOS_CLIENT_ID | Provided to you when subscribing to SOOS services. |
| system.SOOS_API_KEY | Provided to you when subscribing to SOOS services. |

These values can be found in the SOOS App under Integrate.

### Select the mode

#### Run and wait for the analysis report
Set the **Mode** parameter to *Run and wait*, then you can run the plans in your CI/CD, and wait for the scan to complete.

#### Start the Scan
Set the **Mode** parameter to *Async init*, if you don't care about the scan result in your CI/CD plan, this is all you have to do!

#### Wait for the Scan
If you care about the result or want to break the build when issues occur, add a second task close to the end of your plan to give the scan as much time as possible to complete, setting the **Mode** parameter to *Async result*.
